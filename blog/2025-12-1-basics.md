So, some progress has been made.

I'm steadily outlining the basics of the game in our wiki, and I'll be writing up a basic monster guide in the future (hopefully before the end of the year).

I've also been doing some work in the background on the website, slowly transitioning away from the Docusaurus template, and replacing it with our own branding. That's going to be a long progress as I figure out more of the style I want to go with.

Anyway, if you spot any mistakes, use the Nightfall bot on our discord to open an issue, and I or another staff member can fix it.

Hope you have a good day!
