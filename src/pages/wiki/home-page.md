# Introduction to Nightfall

Server IP: play.mcnightfall.com

Server Version: 1.21.1 (or 1.21)

-----

## Basic Overview

### Build Phase
At the start of the game, all players will spawn as survivors and will need to spend some time gathering supplies and preparing for the incoming monsters.
You can:
* Dig gold
* Dig gravel to gain cobblestone
* Craft torches and mortar
* Build defenses

If you're new to the game, focus on digging gold, gravel, and crafting torches and mortar. Defenses can hinder your team if built improperly, and it's a good idea to get a grasp of the basics before you know how to construct a good defense. If you aren't familiar with the map, take some time to walk around so you know where to move when shrines fall. Use your handy compass to get an idea of where things are!

### The Plague
After enough time, a Plague will occur and kill off some survivors, and potentially you as well! If you do die to the plague, you must now fight your former allies as one of the elite units of the monsters. Once "THE MONSTERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED!" appears in chat, the fight will begin.

### Monsters
Monsters will some from the particular mob spawn on the map and begin sieging the shrines. If you are a monster, your goal is to capture the shrines and break the survivors' structures (torches, defenses, consumbables, tool racks) to gain experience and strengthen yourself. If you are a survivor, your goal is to slow the monsters advance with your weapons and abilities and stop them from capturing the shrine as best as you can.

### Shrines
Humming with dwarven power, the shrines are the main goal of the game. As a monster, you must capture them all to end the game by standing next to them. As a survivor, you must keep the monsters from capturing them by slaying them and forcing them back. Shrines take damage the more monsters there are on them, and will slowly heal if there are survivors next to it.

Once a shrine falls, all survivors must retreat to the next shrine and continue the fight.

### Monster Waves
Perioodically, drums will sound across the battlefield, heralding a wave of special monsters with unique abilities. Survivors should be on the lookout so they aren't caught off guard from the dangerous abilities!

Eventually, the drums will sound for much longer, indicating a super wave of monsters is coming, typically with some boss monsters that are extremely threatening. Both sides must work with their allies to make the most of this situation.

### Last Stand
Eventually, the survivors will be whittled down and there is only the last shrine left standing. Once all survivors are defeated (or the last shrine is captured), the game is over.
