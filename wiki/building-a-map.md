# Building a Map

Nightfall's DvZ gamemode has a set of maps, but one way community members can contribute is building a map for the server. The following paragraphs has a list of standards that maps should adhere to when being built.

### Notes

If you build a map, it is not guarenteed to be accepted or playtested. Additionally, the Nightfall staff may make changes to the map if the gamemode requires it, and you should understand that submitting a map to the staff is granting Nightfall permission to use your map in the future forever.

## Map Basics

* Your map should be built on or near the current server version. At time of writing, it is: 1.21 - 1.21.1.
* We recommend disabling the following gamerules to help with building:
    * doMobSpawning
    * doTileDrops
    * doEntityDrops
* There should be 3-5 shrines. 3 is the recommended amount.
* The Run Time between shrines should be 20-30 seconds.
    * Run time is defined as sprint-jumping without any speed modifiers from one shrine to the next
* There should be 2,000-3,000 gold ore blocks, for a total of ~10,000 gold per game.
* There should be 2,000-3,000 gravel blocks for people to dig for building blocks.
* There should be various trees that players can chop for lumber, as well as a Cutting Station (the Stonecutter block), and Oil (Sponge block).

## Recommendations

* First Mob Spawn should be high above the battlefield, and there should be cover from ranged attacks as mobs approach the first shrine
* Have multiple routes to shrines to avoid long hold times
* Inside hallways should be around 5 blocks wide and 7 blocks tall
* Talk with other community members to get feedback on your map
* Keep the pathways from shrine to shrine fairly straightforward, or even mark them out with special blocks. This will reduce confusion as players learn the map layout.

### What to Avoid

Any of the following will have your map rejected:

* Submitting a map you have no permission for (downloaded off of Planet Minecraft, taken from old DvZ). Additionally, you may be banned for plagerism.
* Harassment of any kind, either towards staff to get them to accept the map, or to other community members
* Command Blocks.


## Submission

Message the Nightfall Bot (our discord bot) with a downlaod link to your map. Google Drive or Dropbox are the recommended file hosting services. We recommend sending a few screenshots as well.
The staff may contact you for feedback and recommended changes.

Alongside the Minecraft world files, you should include the following information in the message or as a text document in the download:
* Shrine Names and Locations
* Mob Spawn Locations
* Survivor Spawn Location
* Locations of Interest
* Gravel Count
* Gold Count
* Theme (optional)
