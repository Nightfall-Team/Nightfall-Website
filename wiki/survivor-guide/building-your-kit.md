# Building Your Kit

As a survivor, your kit is important to your survival. It's the set of tools that will allow you to battle monsters and survive.

If you're new to the game, pick one of the pre-made kits on the first page. That way you'll learn the basics of the game before you start experimenting with the options you have available.

## The Pre-Made Kits

You have 3 pre-made kits that you can choose from that will give you a baseline understanding of the game. If you are new, pick the Warrior Kit and don't worry about the kit menu for a few games as you learn the basics.

### Warrior Kit
The all-rounder, the Warrior focuses on a core mechanic, the PROC. The PROC allows you to instantly slay most monsters, making it capable of taking on most monster threats comfortably.

### Paladin Kit
The horde killer, the Paladin focuses on area-of-effect damage. Their tools allow them to be fairly mobile and also deal increased knockback to keep monsters at bay.

### Mage Kit
The spellcaster, the Mage focuses on long ranged attacks and utility. With a flexible Spellbook and the Scepter to buff allies, they are exceptional at keeping their team sustained


## Custom Kits

Once you know the basics, you can start experimenting with the wide array of options available to you.

In general, a kit is composed of:
- A melee weapon
- A ranged weapon
- A healing potion
- An armor
- A couple of accessories
- Some consumables

Mix and match these to your heart's content, though try to keep in mind how your loadout will deal with various parts of the game, such as with zombie hordes, with high-health mob heroes, with general movement, etc.


Omitting a melee, ranged, or healing potion in your kit will cause you to spawn in with a basic one that has no special abilities.


## Special Kits

### Chimera Kit

A kit that embodies chaos, your kit items will randomly swap between a large variety when you take damage. Be prepared for anything, this kit will test your ability to adapt on the fly!

### Old Times Kit

A kit that emulates the old DvZ playstyle, this is similar to the Warrior kit but has the unique ability to 'Bow Proc', granting any arrows you fire while PROCing the ability of the PROC. It also has the unique downside of the bow being much less effective indoors.
